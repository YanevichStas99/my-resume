    <h2>More about myself</h2>
    <h3><p>I am from Dnipro, Ukraine. After getting bachelor degree in Cybersecurity, I decided to move to Czech Republic. For a year Iâ€™ve been learning Czech language in VUT, Brno. During that time, I found a job as Ansible application developer. I`m purposeful, patient, communicative, responsible, punctual, creative, fast-learner. Ready for hard working. In my free time I like to watch some films/series, or play computer games. Also, I like to do some sports like boxing, tai-boxing and working out in a gym.</p></h3>
